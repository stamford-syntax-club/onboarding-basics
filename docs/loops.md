# Loops In JavaScript

**Loops** in JavaScript are control structures that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. They are particularly useful when you need to perform the same set of actions multiple times. JavaScript provides several loop constructs to cater to different looping scenarios such as 

- for loop
- while loop
- do-while loop
- for ‚Ä¶of loop
- for ‚Ä¶in the loop

## For Loop

The **‚Äòfor‚Äô** loop is used when you know the exact number of 
time to loop or iteration you want to perform. It consists of three parts: **`initialization`**, **`condition`**, and **`iteration`**. This **‚Äòfor loop‚Äô** repeatedly executes your specified code block as long as the condition remains true.

### **SYNTAX**

```jsx
for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
  //your set of code blocks to perform every time a loop is completed. 
}
```

### **Example:**

```jsx
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log("Hello World"); //display the value in console.
}
```

### **Output:**

```jsx
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
```

## **While Loop**

The `while` loop evaluates the `condition` inside the parentheses `()`. If¬†the `condition` is **true**, statements inside the body of the `while` loop are executed. Then, the `condition` is evaluated again. The process goes on until the `condition` is evaluated as **false**. 

If the `condition` is **false**, the loop terminates (ends). 

### **SYNTAX**

```jsx
while (condition) {
  // your block of code to perform inside the loop
}
```

### **Example:**

```jsx
//asigning a value to a variable
let i = 0;

//using while loop
while (i < 5) {
	console.log(i + ": " + "Hello World"); //display the value in console.
	i++;
}
```

<aside>
üí° **‚Äù i ‚Äú is a variable that assumes or points to the values of the elements inside the loop.**

</aside>

<aside>
üí° In JavaScript, you can combine **‚ÄúString‚Äù** and **Numbers** by using the **‚Äú + ‚Äú** sign.

</aside>

### **Output:**

```jsx
0: Hello World
1: Hello World
2: Hello World
3: Hello World
4: Hello World
```

## **‚ÄòDo-while‚Äô loop**

The **`do-while`** loop is similar to the **`while`** loop, but the code block is executed at least once before checking the condition. It continues executing as long as the condition remains true.

### **SYNTAX**

```jsx
do {
// your code to be executed in each iteration (loop)
} while (condition);
```

### **Example:**

```jsx
//asigning a value to a variable
let i = 0;

//using do-while loop
do {
	console.log("This is :" + i); //display the value in console.
	i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

### **Output:**

```jsx
This is :0

This is :1

This is :2

This is :3

This is :4
```

## **‚ÄòFor‚Ä¶of‚Äô Loop**

Introduced in ES6, the **`for...of`** loop simplifies iterating (looping) over elements of iterable objects, such as arrays and strings. It provides direct access to the values of the iterable.

### SYNTAX

```jsx
for (const item of iterable) {
    // your code to be executed for each item
}
```

### Example with an array:

```jsx
// array
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];

//using for..of
for (const fruit of fruits) {
    console.log(fruit); //display the value in the console.
}
```

### Output:

```jsx
apple

banana

mango
```

### Example with String:

```jsx
// string
const string = 'hello';

// using for...of the loop
	for (let i of string) {
	console.log(i);
}
```

### **Output:**

```jsx
h
e
l
l
o
```

## ‚ÄòFor‚Ä¶in‚Äô Loop

The `for...in` loop is a basic control statement that allows to loop through the properties of an object. The statements of code found within the loop body will be executed once for each property of the object.

> However, `for‚Ä¶in` loop is not recommended for iterating (loop) over arrays due to potential unexpected behavior.
> 

### SYNTAX

```jsx
for (const key in object) {
	// your code to be executed for each property
}
```

### Example:

```jsx
//create object
const person = {
	name: "Tawan",
	age: 20,
	occupation: "GOD"
};

//using for...in loop
for (const key in person) {
	console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}
```

### Output:

```jsx
name: Tawan
age: 20
occupation: GOD
```

# Now Let‚Äôs Learn How to Control loop flows

<aside>
üí° Loop control statements in JavaScript are used to alter the flow of execution within loops. They allow you to control how and when the loop iterations occur. There are three main loop control statements: **`break`**, **`continue`**, and **`return`**.

</aside>

### **BREAK**

The **`break`** statement is used to immediately exit the loop, regardless of whether the loop condition or iteration is still valid. It's often used when a certain condition is met, and you want to stop the loop's execution.

**Example with ‚Äòfor loop‚Äô:** 

```jsx

//using for loop
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	if (i === 5) {
		break; // exit the loop when "i" equals to 5
	}
	console.log(i);
}
```

**Output:** 

```jsx
0
1
2
3
4
```

### CONTINUE

The `continue` statement lets you skip the current loop iteration and move on to the next one. It's handy when you need to skip specific iterations based on a condition while keeping the loop running.

**Example with ‚ÄòWhile loop‚Äô:** 

```jsx
//initializing varialbe i
let i = 0;

//using while loop
while (i < 10) {
	i++;
	if (i % 2 != 0) { // if "i" divided by 2 and does not have remainder of 0
		continue; // skip odd numbers 
	}
	console.log(i); 
}
```

**Output:**

```jsx
2
4
6
8
10
```

### RETURN

The `return` statement ends **any loop** and functions inside it right away. It's employed when you've finished what you wanted to do and need to stop both the loop and the function early.

```jsx
function findFirstNegative(numbers) {
    for (const num of numbers) {
        if (num < 0) {
            return num; // Return the first negative number
        }
    }
    return null; // Return null if no negative number is found
}

const numbersArray = [5, 8, -3, 10, -6];
const firstNegative = findFirstNegative(numbersArray);

console.log("First negative number:", firstNegative);
```

**Output:** 

```jsx
First negative number: -3
```

# Time to Challenge Yourself!

<aside>
üí° You can **TEST** and **RUN** the following challenges by yourself here ‚Üí

</aside>

[RunJS | JavaScript Playground | Run JavaScript and TypeScript Code Online](https://runjs.co/)

> **Challenge 1: Print out String + numbers**
> 

Write a program using any loop types and print ‚ÄúThe number is: ‚Äù + Number 1 to 5.

**Expected Output:** 

```jsx
The Number is: 1
The Number is: 2
The Number is: 3
The Number is: 4
The Number is: 5
```

<aside>
üí° Hint: You can combine String and numbers by using ‚Äú **+** ‚Äú operators in javascript.

</aside>
<br/>

> **Challenge 2: Counting Even Numbers**
> 

 Write a program that counts and prints the number of even numbers between 1 and 15.
> 

**Expected Output:** 

```jsx
2
4
6
8
10
12
14
```

<aside>
üí° **Hint:** You can use the modulo operator `**%**` to check if a number is even. An even number divided by 2 will have no remainder. Use a loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 15 and prints out all even numbers.
