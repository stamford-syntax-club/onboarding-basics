# Introduction to Backend Onboarding

_Last Updated: 24th Sep 2023_

## What do we do in SSC-Backend?

The backend team at Stamford Syntax Club will be responsible for developing server-side logic, communicating with databases and object storage system, and providing resources for the frontend team as requested.

We separate the source code for frontend and backend apart for the following reasons:

1. _Modularity and Scalability:_ Separating frontend and backend allows each part to evolve independently. You can update or scale one without affecting the other. This modularity makes it easier to manage complex systems and adapt to changing requirements.
2. _Specialization:_ Developers often have different skills and expertise. Frontend developers focus on user interfaces, while backend developers specialize in server-side logic. Separation allows specialists to work on what they do best.
3. _Security:_ By keeping the backend separate from the frontend, sensitive data and critical server-side logic can be protected more effectively. Access controls and security measures can be concentrated on the backend, reducing the attack surface.
